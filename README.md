➡️ Insights Generation: Explored crucial questions such
as average occupancy rates, weekday versus weekend occupancy, city-wise
revenue, monthly revenue trends, and platform-specific revenue analysis.
 
🔥 Skills Developed:
➡️ Proficiency in Python: Expertise in data analysis,
cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
➡️ Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib to craft
engaging charts and graphs.
➡️ Pandas Basics: Mastered techniques for data
manipulation such as groupby, concat, merge, handling NA values, and CSV file
processing.
 
💡 Key Findings:
➡️ Revenue Leaders: Mumbai emerged as the top earner
with 669M INR; May recorded the highest revenue at 581.93M INR.
➡️ Customer Preferences: Presidential rooms received
the highest rating of 3.69; Delhi showcased an average rating of 3.78.
➡️ Occupancy Champion: Delhi not only received
impressive ratings but also boasted the highest occupancy rate at 62.47%.
